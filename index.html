    <h1>Information about Chris</h1>
    <p>
      Hey!
      I'm a third year student (2021) at WPI.
      In terms of academia, I love networking and data analytics projects. Although I think the entire technology stack should be understood to have context for projects.
      Outside of that, I love to cook, build, and generally explore. Curious has always been a defining trait for me, and it leads me to explore new projects and skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm persuing a Computer Science major, with these CS classes under my belt:
      <ul>
        <li>CS 1101</li>
        <li>CS 2010</li>
        <li>CS 2022</li>
        <li>CS 2223</li>
        <li>CS 3013</li>
        <li>CS 2301</li>
        <li>CS 3041</li>
        <li>CS 3733</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a student developer at the WPI Marketing & Communications office. We use:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Node.JS and Drupal CMS</b> for the wpi.edu site front end</li>
        <li><b>MySQL and Python</b> for managing our page/staff databases and general content</li>
        <li><b>Laravel (PHP) and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, and DB</b> for one-off project apps</li>
      </ul>
      For personal projects, I tend to bounce around. Recently I've been into using stateless APIs and using lightweight front end builders such as <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>.
